		<h2> Task 1 </h2>
		
		<p><b> Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</b></p>
		<p> de Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that repeatedly takes intermediate values for each line segment to create a new line segments that will eventually lead to a nice curve. I implemented it by first checking if the number of points is greater than 1 (if it's 1 then return the points vector). Then I used a for loop to generate each pi' (p1' to pn-1') using the formula in the spec.</p>

		<h2> Task 2 </h2>
		
		<p><b> Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces. </b></p>
		<p> We can apply de Casteljau algorithm on bezier surfaces multiple times to extend it. By applying the algorithm to each row of points, we can combine them to do the algorithm in the other direction and finally evaluate the point that we want. In terms of implementing it, evaluateStep is the same as task one but modified to have 3d vectors instead of 2d vectors. Evaluate1D recursively evaluates the next level by calling evaluateStep and then Evaluate1D on that result until the number of points is equal to 1. Evaluate takes each row in controlPoints and evaluates them using evaluate1D and u as t. Then once each row is evaluated we evaluate each result one last time with evaluate1D but with v this time.</p>

		<h2> Task 3 </h2>
		
		<p><b> Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals. </b></p>
		<p> Following the spec, I computed the area of the current face by getting its 3 vertices (the current vertex, vertex of h->next(), and vertex of h->next()->next()) and taking the cross product of 2 vectors created from those points (second point - first point and thrid point - first point), getting the magnitude of that product, and finally dividng by 2 (because it is a triangle). Then, I called h->face()->norm() to get the current face normal and mutliplied it by the area I calculated earlier. After each face is processed, I returned the total sum normalized.</p>

		<h2> Task 4 </h2>
		<p><b> Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used. </b></p>
		<p> I followed the picture in the resources and notes section of the primer and wrote down each edge, vertex, face, and halfedge. I initiated each of them and then wrote down what they should be afterwards. I used setNeighbors() to updated all info for half edges and noted the half edge required for every vertex, edge, and face. Since there isn't any addition or deletion of elements the function is simply reassigning pointers so the main thing was being meticulous about the reference pictures.</p>

		<p> I didn't have to debug a lot thankfully. The only things that I had messed up was setting the outside edges  </p>

		<p> Test Answer </p>
		
		<p><b> Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges? </b></p>
		<p> Test Answer </p>
		
		<p><b> Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects. </b></p>
