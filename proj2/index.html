		<h2> Task 1 </h2>
		
		<p><b> Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</b></p>
		<p> de Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that repeatedly takes intermediate values for each line segment to create a new line segments that will eventually lead to a nice curve. I implemented it by first checking if the number of points is greater than 1 (if it's 1 then return the points vector). Then I used a for loop to generate each pi' (p1' to pn-1') using the formula in the spec.</p>

		<h2> Task 2 </h2>
		
		<p><b> Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces. </b></p>
		<p> We can apply de Casteljau algorithm on bezier surfaces multiple times to extend it. By applying the algorithm to each row of points, we can combine them to do the algorithm in the other direction and finally evaluate the point that we want. In terms of implementing it, evaluateStep is the same as task one but modified to have 3d vectors instead of 2d vectors. Evaluate1D recursively evaluates the next level by calling evaluateStep and then Evaluate1D on that result until the number of points is equal to 1. Evaluate takes each row in controlPoints and evaluates them using evaluate1D and u as t. Then once each row is evaluated we evaluate each result one last time with evaluate1D but with v this time.</p>

		<h2> Task 3 </h2>
		
		<p><b> Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals. </b></p>
		<p> Following the spec, I computed the area of the current face by getting its 3 vertices (the current vertex, vertex of h->next(), and vertex of h->next()->next()) and taking the cross product of 2 vectors created from those points (second point - first point and thrid point - first point), getting the magnitude of that product, and finally dividng by 2 (because it is a triangle). Then, I called h->face()->norm() to get the current face normal and mutliplied it by the area I calculated earlier. After each face is processed, I returned the total sum normalized.</p>

		<h2> Task 4 </h2>
		<p><b> Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used. </b></p>
		<p> I followed the picture in the resources and notes section of the primer and wrote down each edge, vertex, face, and halfedge. I initiated each of them and then wrote down what they should be afterwards. I used setNeighbors() to updated all info for half edges and noted the half edge required for every vertex, edge, and face. Since there isn't any addition or deletion of elements the function is simply reassigning pointers so the main thing was being meticulous about the reference pictures.</p>

		<p><b> Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one. </b></p>
		<p> I didn't have to debug a lot thankfully. The only things that I had messed up was setting the outside edges' next and face after the mesh change. I had assumed that it had to be something within the picture instead of within their own triangle (where they would then become inside edges). I was also pretty worried about typos leading to having a long time debugging. There was one point where I noticed a hole would appear in the mesh if I flipped certain edges which made me double check all of my halfedges as they were the most complex to set. My strategy there was to connect all of the next() and twin() arguments to the other half edges (e.g. making sure that if I followed where h0->next() was set it would lead back to h0 after 2 iterations). Luckily it was there that I found a type in setting the twin of one of the outer edges.</p>

		<h2> Task 5 </h2>
		
		<p><b> Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used. </b></p>
		<p> I created a diagram of before and after and followed the same procedure as task 4. I copied over the initial variables of the 2 triangles, added 6 new half edges, 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 2 new faces. Then I reassigned everything to include the new elements and updated the position of the new vertex to be the mid point of v0 and v1.</p>

		<p><b> Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one. </b></p>
		<p> When I first ran the program and tried to split an edge, it immediately crashed every time. I then used the check_for() function to go through each element and check for null assignments. It was there that I realized I forgot to assign a half edge to one of the new edges, which fixed everything.</p>
		
		<p><b> If you have implemented support for boundary edges, show screenshots of your implementation properly handling split operations on boundary edges. </b></p>
		<p> I did not implement support for boundary edges. </p>
		
		
		<!-- ##################TASK 6##################-->
		
		<h2> Task 6 </h2>
		
		<p><b> Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used. </b></p>
		<p> First I iterated through all of the current edges, set each one's isNew to false, and calculated the new position of the vertex that would be added during a split using the formula in the spec. Then I iterated through all of the vertices, set their isNew to false, grabbed the degree, set u based on the instructions from the spec, used code from the primer to iterate through all of the neighbors's positions, and finally calculated the new position of the old vertex using the formula from the spec.</p>
		
		<p><b> Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges? </b></p>
		<p> Sharp corners slowly become smooth as I keep pressing L. At around 3 rounds of upsampling, the shape was very smooth and round. However, there is a limit to how many times I can upsample before not being able to see any difference besides the number of triangles and my computer starts to get slow(this happens around 5 rounds). By pre-splitting the edges, I could see the shape get a lot smoother in comparison to the edges that I did not split (see last image, top right corner looks smoother in comparison to the rest of the shape which looks just a little bit spikey).</p>

		<p><b> Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects. </b></p>
		<p> As noted before, there appear to be little spikes that happen unless pre-splitting is present. When you split an edge, you are adding more edges and faces for the function to work with. Thus, in a way we can put specific corners/areas of a shape at a higher level of loop division (make specific corners look like they have already been through one round of upsampling in terms of # of faces/edges) while keeping the rest of the shape at the actual level. When we upsample, the places the tend to be spikey appear more smooth like the rest of the shape. This also requires less computation as we get a smoother shape with less rounds of upsampling (only the places that need more triangles get them).</p>
