		<b>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.</b>
		 <p> Simply put, rasterizing a triangle is the process of finding the lines and points that make up the triangle and then testing whether each pixel is inside the triangle or not. If it is, then we render it and if it is not then we leave it alone.</p>
		
		<b>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle. </b>
		
		<p> My algorithm is based off of the point in triangle test from the lecture 2 slides. The boundary box is created by taking the points and finding the min and max coodinartes for the 2 for loops (x & y). This helps avoid checking every pixel on the screen, which would make it slower. Then after all of the checks are done, I call fill_pixel() if the pixel passed the test.</p>
