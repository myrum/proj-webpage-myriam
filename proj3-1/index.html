		<h2> Part 1</h2>
		<b> Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.</b>
		<p> Ray generation works by first calculating the bottom left and top right using hFov and vFov. Then, take the x, y coordinates provided and transform them into camera space via an affine transformation. The equation to transform them was found to be (2 * top_right * x) + bottom_left for both x and y (z is always -1). This was done by solving for a, b, and using the equation x = ax + bx + c. After the point in the camera space is found, it got transformed into world space by multiplying the point by the c2w matrix. This then becomes the direction vector for the ray after being normalized with the pos of the camera being the origin. For raytrace_pixel, the integral is estimated by having a for loop that runs ns_aa times. Within each iteration of the loop, a sample is taken using the grid sampler, added to the x and y inputted, normalized, sent to generate_ray, and the returned ray is sent to est_radiance_global_illumination. Each estimate is added to a sum which gets divided by ns_aa at the end and sent to update_pixel.</p>
		
		<b> Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.</b>
		<p> Triangle intersection was done through MÃ¶ller Trumbore. P0, P1, and P2 correspond to the p1, p2, p3 declared above the intersection functions. E1 was calulated as p1 - p0, e2 was p2 - p0, s was the origin of the ray - p0, s1 was the cross product between the direction of the ray and e2, and s2 was the cross product of s and e1, All the values were then plugged into the formula to get t, b1, and b2. B0 was found by doing 1 - b1 - b2. The restraints of t >= 0, mint_t > t > max_t, and 0 >= b0, b1, b2 >= 1 were all checked (if one condition was not met then the fucntion would return false. If all conditions were met then max_t would be set to t and the new surface normal would be a linear combination of all the b's and their normal counterparts (b0 * n1 + b1 * n2 + b2 * n3). </p>

		<p> test </p>
		
		<b> Focus on one particular scene with at least one area light and compare the noise levels in soft shadows when rendering with 1, 4, 16, and 64 light rays (the -l flag) and with 1 sample per pixel (the -s flag) using light sampling, not uniform hemisphere sampling.</b>

		<b> Compare the results between uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling in a one-paragraph analysis.</b>

		<h2> Part 4 </h2>
		<b> Walk through your implementation of the indirect lighting function.</b>
		<p> test </p>
		
		<b> Show some images rendered with global (direct and indirect) illumination. Use 1024 samples per pixel.</b>
		<p> test </p>
		
		<b> Pick one scene and compare rendered views first with only direct illumination, then only indirect illumination. Use 1024 samples per pixel. (You will have to edit PathTracer::at_least_one_bounce_radiance(...) in your code to generate these views.)</b>
		<p> test </p>
		
		<b> For CBbunny.dae, compare rendered views with max_ray_depth set to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 100 (the -m flag). Use 1024 samples per pixel.</b>
		<p> test </p>
		
		<b> Pick one scene and compare rendered views with various sample-per-pixel rates, including at least 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, and 1024. Use 4 light rays.</b>

		<h2> Part 5 </h2>
		<b> Explain adaptive sampling. Walk through your implementation of the adaptive sampling.</b>
		<p> test </p>
		
		<b> Pick two scenes and render them with at least 2048 samples per pixel. Show a good sampling rate image with clearly visible differences in sampling rate over various regions and pixels. Include both your sample rate image, which shows your how your adaptive sampling changes depending on which part of the image you are rendering, and your noise-free rendered result. Use 1 sample per light and at least 5 for max ray depth.</b>
